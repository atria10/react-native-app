# react-native-app
 This is a simple React Native app I developed to become more familiar with this framework.
 
# Rick and Morty Api
 To develop the app I used the Rick and Morty free-Api. Here's the link to the documentation https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation.
 
# App Structure 
  To create the app I uilized expo.dev (https://expo.dev/).
  The app was initialized as blank Typescript, then I added manually, installing proper libraries the tab structure.
  
 # Features and Functionalities
  While using the app the user can see characters in the first tab-page (Home), in the second (Episodes) can see... obviously the episodes,
  and the third is the personal page.
  
  At the initial point, Personal page requests the user to do login/signup and once the user is logged-in,
  the page shows information like username, nationality and favorites.
  
  I did not use a database so to store data I made use of the Redux library.
  
# Conclusion
  Well I think more or less, I described in general lines the main characteristics of this app. I hope this could help you in some way.
  And of course if you have some feedback please write me. We can improve togheter.
